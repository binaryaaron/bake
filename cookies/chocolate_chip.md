# Josey Baker's Chocolate Chip Cookies

Original found [here](http://www.karenskitchenstories.com/2015/04/browned-butter-chocolate-chip-caramel.html). I've made minor modifications to this, and the browned butter is really the key here.

I have changed the amount of vanilla in the following table to be 50% greater than the original amount.
