- 1 + 1/8 tsp (5.4 gr) salt

**Altered to make 3 NINE INCH pans**


### INSTRUCTIONS
**NOTE: this cake is traditionally baked in a tube pan but also works beautifully baked into layers for a layer cake. This is enough batter for three 9-inch round pans. \* **

### Prep:
- Preheat the oven to 350 F (177 C).
- Prepare your pan(s). If you are using a tube pan grease only the bottom of the pan and not the sides or the tube. If using traditional round tins, line the bottom with parchment and grease the bottom and sides of the pans. 
- Measure out all of your ingredients for each section of the recipe and keep each grouping together to help with the flow of the recipe.
- Mix the Dry Ingredients: Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl and then whisk together to combine. Set aside.
- Mix the Wet Ingredients: In a separate medium bowl, whisk together all of the wet ingredients and set aside.

### Meringue
- In the bowl of a stand mixer fit with the whisk attachment or with a hand mixer, beat the egg whites on medium/high speed until they start forming medium peaks.
- With the mixer still running, slowly stream in the sugar and keep beating until you reach stiff peaks. (NOTE - beat until medium peaks at altitude.)

### Combine

- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredient bowl and stir together with a rubber spatula untile dry ingredients are saturated.
- Add about 3/4 cup of the egg whites into the mixture and stir it in completely to lighten the batter.
- Next add in 1/2 of the rest of the egg whites and gently fold them in being careful not to deflate them.
- Add in the rest of the egg whites and fold them in gently until completely combined.
- Pour the batter into the prepared pans.

### Bake

Bake at 350 F (177 C) for 38-45 minutes if baking in a tube pan or 20-24 minutes if baking in layers.
To check if the cake is done, gently press in on it and if it is firm but springs back it is done.


## Lemon Curd
(This made a lot of extra curd.)
- 6 large egg yolks
- 200g granulated sugar
- 1.5 Tablespoon lemon zest (about 1.5 lemons)
- 1/2 cup (120ml) fresh lemon juice (about 4 lemons)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 9 Tablespoons (120g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature


## Icing
(in the future, make a bit more than this.)
* 1.5 cup soft mascarpone cheese
* 1.5 cup heavy whipping cream
* 45g confectioners' sugar
* 3/4 cup lemon curd
* 3 cups fresh raspberries


- In a large bowl, whip the whipping cream and confectioners sugar together until soft peaks form.
- add the vanilla.
- Run a spoon through the mascarpone to break it up a little
- Add mascarpone to the whipped cream and beat again until it's thick and spreadable.
- Add the lemon curd and swirl through with a spatula.
