This is a three-layer cake with meringue icing.

## cakes (three layers)

I adjusted baking soda/powder according to Pie in the Sky, but failed to use the whisk attachment when mixing the cakes. I *think* this is why the cake failed to rise well, but i could have possibly reduced the leaveners a bit too much. `¯\_(ツ)_/`

- 4.875 oz all purpose flour
- 4.125 oz cake flour
- 0.9 teaspoon baking soda
- 0.9 teaspoon baking powder
- 0.75 teaspoon salt

- 6 oz unsalted butter, room temperature
- 9.75 oz granulated sugar
- 4 eggs (3 plus 1 for altitude)

- 7.5 oz buttermilk (milk + 1 tbsp lemon juice)
- zest and juice of 1 large lemon




## Meringue

- 3½ oz water
- 14 oz granulated sugar
- 5 oz egg whites, room temperature
- 16 oz unsalted butter, cut into 1” cubes
- zest and juice of 1 large lemon

Bring sugar to 238; whip egg whites to soft peaks. Whip at high speed and add the sugar syrup to the meringue; let cool to room temperature whilst beating. At this point, add in butter slowly; beat until smooth.

I iced the cake and piped around.


## Decor

I carved and then candied several buddah's hand fingers. made the sugar syrup again and boiled the pieces for about 40 minutes. pulled out the fingers and decorated the cake with them before they hardened.
