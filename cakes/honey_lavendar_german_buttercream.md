## Honey Lavender Cake
- 3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 1/2 cups (300g) sugar
- 1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp (90ml) liquid honey
- 1 1/2 tsp (7.5ml) vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp (2.5ml) lavender extract (optional)
- 3 eggs, at room temperature
- 2 2/3 cups (390g) all-purpose flour
- 2 1/4 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 Tbsp culinary lavender, finely ground in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle
- 1 cup (240ml) whole milk


1. Preheat the oven to 350f/180c.
2. Grease and flour three 6 inch cake pans

3. Using an electric beater, or in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter until pale.
4. Add sugar and beat for another five minutes or until light and fluffy.
5. Add honey, vanilla, and lavender extract, and mix until incorporated.
6. Add eggs one at a time and beat well after each addition, stopping to scrape down the bowl as necessary.
7. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and dried lavender.
8. Starting and ending with the flour mixture, alternately add flour and milk to the batter, and mix until well incorporated.
9. Divide the mixture between the tins and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until golden and a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean.
10. Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then cool completely on a wire rack.


## Vanilla german buttercream
- 1 1/2 cups (375ml) milk
- 1 Tbsp Vanilla bean paste, extract, or the scrapings of one vanilla bean
- 1 cup plus 2 Tbsp (255g) sugar
- 3 Tbsp (24g) corn starch
- 1 egg
- 2 egg yolks
- 3 cups (675g, or 6 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature.
- pinch of salt
- Gel food colouring in your chosen colour


1. In a bowl, whisk together the sugar, corn starch, egg, egg yolk and salt.
2. In a medium non-stick saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla to just shy of a simmer. Remove from the heat.

3. Using one hand to whisk constantly, pour half of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. Whisk until incorporated, and then pour the whole lot back into the saucepan.

4. Heat the milk and egg mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it begins to bubble. (This happened for me at roughly 185).
5. Pour into a shallow dish or bowl of a stand mixer and press some plastic wrap over the surface to avoid a skin from forming.
6. Refrigerate until cold. (this took upwards of 2 hours for me).

7. Fit your mixer with the whisk attachment.
8. Whip the custard mixture on medium until creamy and lump-free.
9. Begin adding the butter, a few cubes at a time, until fully incorporated. Switch to the paddle attachment and beat for a few minutes until smooth and silky.




## Lavender milk chocolate ganache
- 200g (7oz) milk chocolate
- 100g (100ml) heavy cream
- 1 Tbsp culinary grade lavender

*NOTE: do not prepare ganache until ready to use - the cake requires 1-2 hours to cool so ensure to allow enough time for this.*

1. In a medium pot over low heat, heat the cream until almost boiling.
2. Add culinary lavender and steep for 15 minutes.
3. Strain and top up to 100G if necessary.
4. Return the strained cream to the stove and heat again until hot and just beginning to boil. 
5. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl.
6. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, and stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.
7. Leave to sit for 10-15 minutes to thicken slightly.
