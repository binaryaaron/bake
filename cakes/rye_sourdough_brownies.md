## Prepare; let rise

- place all the stage 1 ingredients in a 300ml (½ pint) jar or container with a
lid, mix, cover and leave at warm room temperature for 4–6 hours.
- prepare 'dough'. place 125g (4 oz) of the starter in a large bowl, add eggs
rye flour, and sugar,   stir well with a whisk, cover and leave in a warm place
for at least  1–2 hours.  It won’t rise much but you should see some bubbles as evidence of
fermentation on the surface of the mix.
- prepare chocolate.  In the hour before you plan to do the
final mix and bake, melt the butter and chocolate in a small heatproof bowl
over a pan of simmering water. Set aside to cool for 30 minutes.
- prepare pan:  line a 25cm (10 in) square tin with baking parchment.


## final stages
- Preheat the oven to 160ºC/325ºF/gas mark 3. 
- Add the melted chocolate and butter plus the remaining  
ingredients into the bowl with the batter. Whisk until well combined.
- Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top with the back of a spoon so it is evenly
distributed. 

## bake
- Bake for 30-40 minutes until the top looks dry but it still has a
slight wobble. It’s difficult to overbake these.
- Sprinkle with additional sea salt, if liked, after they come out of the oven and leave to cool in the tin.
