## process

### Dough prep
- make the leavain overnight or 5h~ prior to the autolyse.
- autolyse the flour and salt with all but 50g of water for 1-2 hours; keep warm (75--80F)
- mix in levain with the rest of the water. slap and fold or stretch in bowl for 5-8 minutes -- it's good to build strength in this dough
- let rise for 4~ hours (or longer, overnight in cooler ambient temps), doing sets of folds for the first few hours as needed.
- shape; set into oiled sandwich bread pan
- refrigerate for at least 12 hours


### Baking

- preheat oven to 500F for at least 30 min  (original recipe calls for 1 hour. I have a baking steel that sits in the oven at all times to help regulate temperature)
- Score the dough right before you put it in the oven
- Bake at 450G with steam for 20 minutes
- Bake at 450F without steam for 30 minutes
- Bake at 425F for 15-20 minutes until internal temperature is at least 205F
