# High Hydration Sourdough

The non-nuanced version of [this brilliant recipe](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/best-sourdough-recipe/). I highly, highly recommend visiting that site to get a great breakdown of the nuances of flour selection and preparation. This is mostly a quick reference for me. 

## Overview

Wonderful high-hydration sourdough that may take a few tries to get right, but when you do... oh my. This requires a pretty active starter. Please see the above reference for high detail. 

- Total dough weight: 1800g
- Total pre-fermented flour: 6.4%
- Hydration: 87%
- Yield: 2 x 900g loaves

## Levain 

| ingredient     | mass | percentage |
|----------------|------|------------|
| Liquid Starter | 35g  | 50%        |
| Whole Wheat    | 35g  | 50%        |
| White          | 35g  | 50%        |

## dough

| ingredient        | mass | percentage |
|-------------------|------|------------|
| bread flour       | 804g | 91.67%     |
| whole wheat flour | 73g  | 8.33%      |
| water, 90 F       | 755g | 86.11%     |

## process

### Dough prep
- make the leavain overnight or 5h~ prior to the autolyse.
- autolyse the flour and salt with all but 50g of water for 1-2 hours; keep warm (75--80F)
- mix in levain with the rest of the water. slap and fold or stretch in bowl for several minutes.
- let rise for 4~ hours (or longer, overnight in cooler ambient temps), doing sets of folds for the first few hours as needed.
- divide into two masses, let sit for several minutes
- shape; set into bannetons
- refrigerate for at least 12 hours

#### Notes
I've let this dough sit in the fridge for 1-7 nights and it's always delicious. The less time you leave it in the fridge, the better rise you'll get out of it, and the longer you leave it in, the stronger the flavors get (and the dough can get a bit sloppy as well). 

### Baking

- preheat oven to 500F for at least 30 min  (original recipe calls for 1.5hours. I have a baking steel that sits in the oven at all times to help regulate temperature)
- Score the dough right before you put it in the oven (I usually do an "X" pattern)
- Bake at 500F with steam (I use a dutch oven) for 20-30 minutes
- Bake at 450F without steam (remove the lid) until done (I pull mine out when the internal temperature is at least 210F). 

#### Notes
you can leave the lid on the dutch oven the entire time and it's not going to hurt the bread. Remove the steam as directed for a darker, harder crust, or leave it for a softer end product.
